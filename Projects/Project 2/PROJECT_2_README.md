# Project 2: Regression Challenge

## Problem Statement
The question I wish to answer is: What are factors that have a great effect on housing price?

I will create models for housing price prediction based on multiple key factors.

1. Find the factors that have the greatest effect on housing price, particularly price per square feet

2. Find out the undervalued houses based on my model

## Datasets

### Provided Data Sets
1. Train Data from Kaggle
2. Test Data from Kaggle

### Cleaned Data Sets
1. Location and Proximity Data
2. Parts of Home Data
3. PRice Factors Data
4. Time Factors Data
5. Utilities and Intangible Factors Data
6. Cleaned Train Data
7. Cleaned Test Data
8. Cleaned Test Data with Home ID

## Conclusions and Findings

### 1. Finding Undervalued Homes using my Model

### 1. Finding the Factors that have an effect on Home Value
